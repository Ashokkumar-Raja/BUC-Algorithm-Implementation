# BUC-Algorithm-Implementation

The script BUC.py is written in python programming language, version 3. 
BUC is an efficient recursive algorithm for iceberg cube computation.
Here it performs and records the data in a new text file based on the minimum support which is entered when the code prompts the user for it.
Ran the script in timberlea as well and it's working good.

Instructions to compile and execute the script:
1. Make sure the script and the Product_Sales_Data_Set.csv are in the same directory.
2. Then run the script BUC.py which will execute the code.
